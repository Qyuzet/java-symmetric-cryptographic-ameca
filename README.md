## System Analysis

### Overview

AMECA is developed to provide a practical implementation of symmetric encryption. Key features include:

- **Java-based Desktop Application:** Built with Java, making it cross-platform and robust.
- **Symmetric Encryption:** Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
- **Powered by AES:** Implements Advanced Encryption Standard for strong encryption..

## Design Interface

### User Interface

AMECA's user interface is designed with simplicity and usability in mind. It features:

- **FlatLightLaf UI:** A modern and clean look for ease of use.
- **User-Friendly Controls:** Easy input for plaintext and encryption keys, and clear display of ciphertext.

## Database Design

### Structure

The database is structured to store encrypted messages along with the corresponding encryption keys and original plaintext. This design facilitates easy retrieval and management of encrypted data..

## Table Design

The table design is as follows:

| NO | Field Name | Data Type | Length | Description                      |
|----|-------------|-----------|--------|----------------------------------|
| 1  | sender      | varchar   | 50     | Sender name (cryptographer)      |
| 2  | enKey       | varchar   | 32     | Encryption key                   |
| 3  | plain       | varchar   | 2000   | Original plaintext               |
| 4  | cipher      | varchar   | 2000   | Encrypted ciphertext             |

### General Flowchart

The general flowchart outlines the high-level processes of AMECA, including message input, encryption, decryption, and output.

### Detailed Flowchart

The detailed flowchart breaks down each step of the process, including:

1. **Message Input:** User inputs plaintext and encryption key.
2. **Encryption Process:** The system encrypts the plaintext using the provided key.
3. **Decryption Process:** The system decrypts the ciphertext using the provided key.
4. **Message Output:** The decrypted plaintext is displayed to the user.

## Code Configuration

### Java Code

Key components of the Java code include:

#### Set UI Style

- **FlatLightLaf UI:** Sets the UI to a modern and clean look.

#### Koneksi Package

- **Database Connection:** Handles the connection to the local database.
- **Connection Snippet:** Code to establish a connection to the database.

#### Cryptography Class Code

- **Check Key Function:** Verifies the provided encryption key.
- **Show Data Function:** Displays stored data from the database.
- **Find Data Function:** Searches for specific data in the database.
- **Main Process:** Handles the main CRUD operations (create, read, update/change).
- **Delete Process:** Handles the deletion of records.

## Installation
